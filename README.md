# SPL_video_PSD_analysis
This code provides robust diagnostics for Skin Potential Level (SPL) signals. It uses a median-Welch PSD and filters artifacts to map signal energy across key frequency bands (f95/f99) and quantifies power-line noise. The results guide decisions on analysis bandwidth, mains filtering, and safe downsampling targets.
